DuraGen Plus® Dural Regeneration Matrix is Integra’s most optimized onlay graft. DuraGen Plus Dural Regeneration Matrix is an absorbable implant that is indicated as a dural substitute for repair of dura mater. DuraGen Plus has a more consistent collagen structure for superior handling over original DuraGen. After implantation, DuraGen Plus is infiltrated by fibroblasts and is fully resorbed and replaced with endogenous tissue. DuraGen Plus is manufactured from Ultra Pure Collagen™, handles and conforms similar to normal soft tissue, and has an excellent safety profile.
