DuraGen XS™ Dural Regeneration Matrix is Integra’s most advanced onlay graft. DuraGen XS Dural Regeneration Matrix is an absorbable implant that is indicated as a dural substitute for repair of dura mater. DuraGen XS benefits from 30% more collagen, which provides increased tensile trength and more robust handling over DuraGen Plus. After implantation, DuraGen XS is infiltrated by fibroblasts and is fully resorbed and replaced with endogenous tissue. DuraGen XS is manufactured from Ultra Pure Collagen™, handles and conforms similar to normal soft tissue, and has an excellent safety profile.
